Description: During pregnancy, many women report feelings of disgust toward
    ordinary foods, and cravings for particular foods. The purpose of this study
    is to answer questions about the socioecological, environmental, psychological,
    and adaptive influences of such dietary shifts in pregnancy. Specifically,
    this study aims to answer the following questions: 1) What role does social
    learning (culture) and social norms have in the types of foods/non-foods that
    are craved and avoided during pregnancy? 2) Do environmental factors, such as
    resource scarcity (i.e. food insecurity) and pathogen risk, influence putative
    dietary shifts in pregnancy? 3) What role does nausea and vomiting in
    pregnancy (NVP) have in predicting dietary shifts?
