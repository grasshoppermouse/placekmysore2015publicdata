#' Data on pregnancy diet in Mysore, India.
#'
#' During pregnancy, many women report feelings of disgust toward ordinary foods,
#' and cravings for particular foods. The purpose of this study is to answer
#' questions about the socioecological, environmental, psychological, and
#' adaptive influences of such dietary shifts in pregnancy. Specifically,
#' this study aims to answer the following questions: 1) What role does social
#' learning (culture) and social norms have in the types of foods/non-foods that
#' are craved and avoided during pregnancy? 2) Do environmental factors, such as
#' resource scarcity (i.e. food insecurity) and pathogen risk, influence putative
#' dietary shifts in pregnancy? 3) What role does nausea and
#' vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) have in predicting dietary shifts?
#'
#' Data were collected Summer 2015.
